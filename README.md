## Envirenment Variables

For using news fetch apis you need to add this envirenment variable with your own api keys

REACT_APP_GUARDIAN_API_KEY = <Your guardian api-key> [https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/]
REACT_APP_NYTIMES_API_KEY = <Your nytimes api-key> [https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started]
REACT_APP_NEWSAPI_API_KEY = <Your newsapi api-key> [https://newsapi.org/account]

!!! Make sure that you re-run the application if the envirenment variables don't work !!!
